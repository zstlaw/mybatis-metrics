TODO
====

Here are the items that are on my list of tasks and should be considered by any contributor:

* Remove at least some of the limitations. See <LIMITATIONS.md>
* Add JaCoCo agent during testing and then generate code coverage report.
* Add static analysis of the source code - having Sonar analysis would be very nice.
* Expand on JavaDocs and add documentation with usage examples. This could be done based on current integration tests.
